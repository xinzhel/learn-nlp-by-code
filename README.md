I üòç the quote: "Talk is cheap, show me the code." So I made this repository to record my code analysis for popular machine learning and Natural Language Processing libraries or frameworks.

I would go through the following packages for both learning purpose and practical research. Some of code analysis are linked to my notebooks on Kaggle for easy running.
* [AllenNLP](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp)
* [FairSeq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq)
* Python
* Pytorch
  * [AutoGrad](https://www.kaggle.com/sergioli212/autograd-behind-gradient-descent)
* SpaCy
