This repository give a brief demonstration of my code analysis for `AllenNLP`. 

Understanding a concept of an algorithm or using given functions of a software is cheap but learning the beauty of a good implementation is more challenging and enjoyable for me. I found that `AllenNLP` is kinda cool to embrace many ideas of programming desgin and NLP algorithms. I hope to learn these two perspectives by taking advantage of analyzing the code.
