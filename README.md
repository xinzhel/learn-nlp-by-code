I üòç the quote: "Talk is cheap, show me the code." So I decide to make this repository to only summarize my code analysis for popular machine learning and Natural Language Processing libraries or frameworks.

I would go through the following packages for both learning purpose and practical research. Some of code analysis are linked to my notebooks on Kaggle for easy running.

* Python
* Pytorch
  * [`nn.Module` for building neural network](https://www.kaggle.com/sergioli212/neural-network-pytorch-module) 
  * [AutoGrad](https://www.kaggle.com/sergioli212/autograd-behind-gradient-descent)
  
* SpaCy
* AllenNLP
  * [Using JSON configuration files to manage experiments](https://github.com/xinzhel/learn-nlp-by-code/blob/master/allennlp_config.md)
