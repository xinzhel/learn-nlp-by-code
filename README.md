"Talk is cheap, show me the code."

I would go through the details of code for NLP implementations for both learning purpose and practical research. Packages include
* [AllenNLP](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp)
* [FairSeq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq)
* Python
* Pytorch
  * [AutoGrad](https://www.kaggle.com/sergioli212/autograd-behind-gradient-descent)
